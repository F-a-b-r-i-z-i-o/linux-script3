# linux-script3

A bash script that gives 2 input text files (f1 and f2) produces the following selection menu for the user:
- 1. remove both files
- 2. archive both files
- 3. appends file f1 to file f2
- 4. quit

- Implement every function of the menu above
- For option 1 it asks for confirmation before removal
- For option 2 it produces the compressed archive f1f2.tar.gz (the name is given by the two names of the concatenated files)
- NOT used the builtin select to implement the menu
